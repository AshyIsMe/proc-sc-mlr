This app is a basic clone of mlr done to teach us about Processing and SuperCollider.
- Aaron.

Usage:
Start up MonomeSerial prefix "/box" (i think this is required).
Start up SuperCollider and boot server.
Start proc-sc-mlr.
Drag some wav (or aif) files onto the window and then press some buttons on the monome.
Top row turns off samples and rows below allow you to skip through each sample.
